def sqrt_fixed(y, prec):
    """
    Square root of a fixed-point number.

    Given the big integer y = floor(x * 2**prec), this function returns
    floor(r * 2**prec) where r = sqrt(x).

    We start from a 50-bit estimate for r generated with ordinary
    floating-point arithmetic, and then refines the value to full
    accuracy using the iteration

                 1  /        y  \
        r     = --- | r  +  --- |
         n+1     2  \ n     r_n /

    which is simply Newton's method applied to the equation r**2 = y.

    Newton's method doubles the accuracy with each step. We make use of
    this fact by only using a precision corresponding to the current
    accuracy during intermediate iterations. For example, with a 50-bit
    accurate r_1, r_2 can be computed using 100-bit precision, r_3
    using 200-bit precision, and so on. (In practice, the precision
    levels must be chosen slightly more conservatively to account for
    rounding errors in the last one or two bits.)

    It is assumed that x ~= 1 (the main fsqrt() function fiddles with
    the exponent of the input to reduce it to unit magnitude before
    passing it here.)

    TODO: it would be possible to specify separate precision levels
    for the input and output, which could be useful when calculating
    pure-integer square roots.

        # The "-1" divides by two in the same step.

        # In the second term, we do a fixed-point division using the usual
        # formula (y<<precision)//r. The precision term is a bit messy and
        # takes into account the fact that y, r_n and r_{n+1} all have
        # different precision levels. As before, the "-1" divides by two.

def sqrt_fixed2(y, prec):
    """
    This function is essentially equivalent to sqrt_fixed (see its
    documentation), but uses an asymptotically faster algorithm.

    Instead of using Newton's method to calculate sqrt(y) directly,
    we calculate 1/sqrt(y) with Newton's method and multiply by y to
    obtain sqrt(y). The Newton iteration for 1/sqrt(y) is

                 r
                  n      /            2 \
        r    =  ----  *  | 3  - y * r   |.
         n+1      2      \           n  /

    This is slightly slower at low precision levels since it requires
    three multiplications in each step, as opposed to the single
    division in the Newton iteration for sqrt(y).

    However, since Python uses Karatsuba algorithm for multiplication,
    three multiplications can be performed much more quickly than a
    single division at high precision levels. In practice, the cutoff
    where sqrt_fixed2 becomes faster than sqrt_fixed seems to be around
    60,000 bits.
