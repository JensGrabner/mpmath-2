# normalize() is the workhorse function in mpmath. All floating-point

#  1) convert floating-point problem to an equivalent integer problem
#  2) solve integer problem using Python integer arithmetic
#  3) use normalize() to convert the integer solution to a canonical
#     floating-point number
#
# A number of hacks are used in normalize() to reduce the overhead of step
# (3) as far as possible.

# normalize improves performance at 15-digit precision by ~15%

# which calls math.log. However, for prec ~< 200 bits, converting to a 
# hex string and using table lookup for the last four bits is slightly
# faster. This idea was taken from decimal.py
