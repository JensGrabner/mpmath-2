--0.4--
Released November 3, 2007

* new string conversion code (much faster; unlimited exponents)
* fixed bug in factorial (it gave the wrong value, though gamma worked)
* division now uses a rigorous algorithm for directed rounding
  (mpmath previously used a heuristic that got the last bit wrong
  in 1/10000 of cases)
* misc. performance improvements (arithmetic is 15% faster)
* refactored parts of the code; added many more docstrings and tests
* added a function rand() for generating full-precision random numbers
* rewrote the benchmark script to compare against Decimal and to
  automatically generate timings with psyco both disabled and enabled
* rewrote unit tests to use py.test

--0.3--
Released October 5, 2007

* fixed high-precision accuracy problem in complex sqrt
* fixed high-precision accuracy problem in atan and complex log
* fixed directed rounding for sqrt (always rounded to nearest)
* implemented all hyperbolic and inverse functions (there are some
  accuracy issues left to sort out)
* included gamma, factorial, erf, zeta incomplete gamma functions
* made sin and tan more accurate for complex input very close to 0
* more docstrings
* many more tests
* including a benchmark script
