1. Download & installation
--------------------------

mpmath requires a recent version of Python. It has been tested with
Python 2.5 and should work with Python 2.4.

The latest release of mpmath can be downloaded from the mpmath
website. It should also be available in the Python Package Index at
http://pypi.python.org/pypi

To install, unpack the mpmath archive and run

  python setup.py install

The latest development code is available at
http://mpmath.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/


2. Documentation
----------------

See doc/manual.html and the mpmath website.


3. Application code and demos
-----------------------------

In addition to the base arithmetic, mpmath provides various more or less
useful functions and demo scripts. These features are described in more
detail on the mpmath wiki.

* Numerical integration: the quadts() function
  Permits computing integrals with hundreds of digits of precision.

  -- see http://code.google.com/p/mpmath/wiki/NumericalIntegration

* Interval arithmetic: the mpi class
  -- see http://code.google.com/p/mpmath/wiki/IntervalArithmetic

* Educational interval arithmetic demo: mpmath/apps/taylordemo.py

* Pi digits demo: mpmath/apps/pidigits.py
  This script can be run interactively. It can compute 100,000's of digits
  of pi fairly quickly, and prints them in nicely formatted columns.


4. Known problems
-----------------

mpmath is a work in progress. Major issues include:

* mpmath temporarily increases the working precision during function
  evaluations to suppress the effects of intermediate rounding errors.
  In most functions, the precision is currently increased by a fixed amount
  that gives accurate results for "normal" input. Close to zeros and
  singularities, and/or with the precision set to (say) several hundred
  digits, the last few digits in a result may be wrong.

* Directed rounding works for arithmetic operations. It is implemented
  heuristically for other operations, and their results may be off by one
  or two units in the last place (even if otherwise accurate).

* Some IEEE 754 features are not available. Inifinities and NaN are
  partially supported; denormal rounding is currently not available
  at all.

* The interface for switching precision and rounding is not finalized.
  The current method is not threadsafe.
