## How to cite mpmath ##

Please include the URL to the mpmath website and, if relevant, also list the version number. In BibTeX format, the following entry can be used:
```
@manual{mpmath,
  key     = {mpmath},
  author  = {Fredrik Johansson and others},
  title   = {mpmath: a {P}ython library for arbitrary-precision floating-point arithmetic (version 0.14)},
  note    = {{\tt http://code.google.com/p/mpmath/}},
  month   = {February},
  year    = {2010},
}
```

This might render as:

  * Fredrik Johansson et al. _mpmath: a Python library for arbitrary-precision floating-point arithmetic (version 0.14)_, February 2010. http://code.google.com/p/mpmath.

Change the version number to the version you used, and the date to the date of its release. (All previous versions are available on the downloads page.)
