#summary Summary of missing features and bugs in mpmath

==Fundamental issues==

===Bugs===
  * Directed rounding for square roots and transcendental functions does not always work
  * Sine and cosine lose accuracy near zeros other than at x = 0
  * mpfs are not eval-repr-invariant at some precision levels
  * Complex mul, div, sqrt and tan lose accuracy for numbers with very large real and very small imaginary parts
  * Some functions don't handle inifinities and nans

===Nice-to-have features===
  * Optional denormal rounding
  * IEEE 754-compatible exception handling
  * A magic constant `eps` (similar to eps in Matlab) that changes with the precision
  * Functions for rounding to the next nearby floating-point number (up or down) at a given precision

===Misc===
  * Interface for switching precision and rounding is not finalized (use context objects like decimal?)

==Extensions==
Code for:
  * Root finding
  * Solving ODEs
  * Numerical summation
  * ...
