#summary Summary of missing features and bugs in mpmath

==Significant missing features==
  * Floor/ceiling functions
  * Divmod and mod operations
  * Support for nans/infinities

==Bugs==
  * Directed rounding for square roots and transcendental functions does not always work
  * Sine and cosine lose accuracy near zeros other than at x = 0
  * mpfs are not eval-repr-invariant at some precision levels
  * Complex mul, div, sqrt and tan lose accuracy for numbers with very large real and very small imaginary parts

==Nice-to-have features==
  * Optional denormal rounding
  * IEEE 754-compatible exception handling
  * A magic constant `eps` (similar to eps in Matlab) that changes with precision
  * Functions for rounding to the nearest higher/lower floating-point number at a given precision

==Misc==
  * Interface for switching precision and rounding is not finalized (use context objects like decimal?)
