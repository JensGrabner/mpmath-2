==About mpmath==

Mpmath is a pure-Python library for arbitrary-precision floating-point arithmetic. It implements a large set of mathematical functions and provides utilities for arbitrary-precision numerical differentiation, integration, root-finding, interval arithmetic, and other tasks. It supports unlimited exponent sizes, has full support for complex numbers, and is faster than Python's standard `decimal` library.

Mpmath is free (BSD license) and easy to install or include in other software due to being written entirely in Python with no additional dependencies. It can be used as a standalone library or via [http://code.google.com/p/sympy SymPy] which uses it for numerical evaluation of symbolic expressions. Mpmath can optionally use [http://code.google.com/p/gmpy gmpy] to speed up computations with thousands of digits.

==List of features==

Arithmetic:
  * Real and complex numbers with arbitrary precision
  * Unlimited exponent sizes / magnitudes
  * Support for infinities and not-a-numbers
  * Directed rounding
  * Rudimentary interval arithmetic

Functions:
  * Elementary functions (sqrt, exp, log, trigonometric, hyperbolic, inverse trig and hyperbolic)
  * Standard mathematical constants: pi, e, the golden ratio, Euler's constant (gamma)
  * Less standard constants: Catalan's, Apery's, Khinchin's and Glaisher's constants
  * Lambert W function (all branches)
  * Error function (erf)
  * Gamma functions (complete and incomplete), factorials and binomial coefficients
  * Riemann zeta function and Bernoulli numbers
  * Bessel function of the first kind, Airy functions
  * Exponential and trigonometric integrals
  * Arithmetic-geometric mean
  * Complete elliptic integrals
  * Jacobi elliptic functions
  * Jacobi, Legendre and Chebyshev polynomials
  * Generic hypergeometric functions

High-level features:
  * Integration
  * Differentiation
  * Limits and summation of infinite series (with convergence acceleration)
  * Root-finding
  * Polynomial evaluation and root-finding
  * Chebyshev approximation
  * Basic ODE solvers
  * Integer relation detection (constant recognition)

==Demonstration==

A few different ways to compute pi (here to 50 decimal places): directly, as special values of various functions, using quadrature of the unit circle, quadrature of a Gaussian integral, accelerated summation of the slowly convergent Leibniz series, a limit of a sequence, and root-finding. To test mpmath, you can paste the following directly into an interactive Python session:

{{{
from mpmath import *
mp.dps = 50
print pi
print 2*asinh(j).imag
print gamma(0.5)**2
print sqrt(6*zeta(2))
print quadts(lambda x: 4*sqrt(1-x**2), 0, 1)
print quadts(lambda x: exp(-x**2), -inf, inf) ** 2
print sumsh(lambda n: 4*(-1)**n/(2*n+1), 0, inf)
print limit(lambda n: 2**(4*n+1)*factorial(n)**4/(2*n+1)/factorial(2*n)**2, inf)
print secant(sin, 3.14)
}}}

Each command should print `3.1415926535897932384626433832795028841971693993751`.

Some additional demo scripts are available:
  * [http://code.google.com/p/mpmath/source/browse/trunk/demo/pidigits.py pidigits.py] -- print thousands of digits of pi in any base
  * [http://code.google.com/p/mpmath/source/browse/trunk/demo/manydigits.py manydigits.py] -- outputs solutions to [http://www.cs.ru.nl/~milad/manydigits/problems.php Many Digits competition problems]
  * [http://code.google.com/p/mpmath/source/browse/trunk/demo/taylor.py taylor.py] -- educational interval arithmetic

Some example computations with high precision:
  * [http://mpmath.googlecode.com/svn/data/golden_ratio.txt The golden ratio] to 100,000 digits (computed in 4 seconds)
  * [http://mpmath.googlecode.com/svn/data/glaisher.txt Glaisher's constant] to 20,000 digits (computed in 16 hours)
  * [http://mpmath.googlecode.com/svn/data/khinchin.txt Khinchin's constant] to 6,000 digits (computed in 8 hours)
  * [http://mpmath.googlecode.com/svn/data/bernoulli.txt 2500 Bernoulli numbers] with 64 digits (computed in 1 minute)
